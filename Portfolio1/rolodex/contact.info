Description: 
The program is a phone book. It 
holds first name, last name, street, town, 
zip, phone, and email. The phone book can hold up 
to 100 entries. The menu page has a few different options 
Add, Edit, Delete, Find, and Print all entries. The sub menu 
for the find button allows to be found by Name, Address, 
Phone, and Email. The sub menu for the Edit allows you to edit 
any of those data types above. You can select it by using the INT 
or First Char. Once completed it will bring you back to the main menu. 
You can use the delete feature to delete entry of your choosing. 
Then you can finally use the print all entry option to get a table of 
each entry.

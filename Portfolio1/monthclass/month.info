Description: The menu of the program has four options SetMonth, GetMonth, 
AdanceMonth, RetreatMonth, and Exit. SetMonth will allow you to enter
a string or integer value for the month. GetMonth will return 
the integer value stored in the class via a string of the month. 
AdvanceMonth is looking for a integer/string(probably should remove that) advancement which will update 
the month if less than 12. RetreatMonth will do the exact same thing but will go backwards. Exit button 
will end the program.

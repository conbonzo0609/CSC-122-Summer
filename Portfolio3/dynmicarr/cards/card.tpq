1) No enumerators behave as constants

2)We can use substr and also find the length of the inputted value.

 if(card == dia.substr(0 , cardL) ) 
                mySuit = diamonds;

If the data is equal we set it to our suit


3) 
Yes we need Substr which is from 'String' library

4) 
Aces, kings, queens, jacks, and 2-10.
